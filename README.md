# HungryCapybara
HungryCapybara is a video game for Nintendo DS I made in my first year of computer engineering. Have fun playing it! There is an easter-egg hiden :)

The only file you need to download in order to play it is HungryCapybara.nds.

In the 'Source' folder you will find the codes, written in C language, used to create the game.
In the 'Include' folder are the auxiliary codes for defining variables or program headers.
The 'GFX' folder contains all the background pictures used for the game.
I assume the 'Build' folder is the one created when saving and running the project, I did not pay a lot of attention in that class.
Finally, in 'Extras' you will find... well... extras, like a sketch of how the game works (Automata.pdf) or a more detailed report (Informe.pdf) in Spanish.
